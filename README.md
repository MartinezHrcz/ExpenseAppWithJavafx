## **Background**
---
This is a simple expense and income managing app written in Java which uses JavaFX for UI
The idea was co-founded with my friend (ricsix19) who i started this project together 
but before the code review (just before merging the best codes from each branch) of our branches i took my branch for self development.
Before transitioning to this repository, only the barebones funcitions existed with only console UI.
